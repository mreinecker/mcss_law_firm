                        <h5>Personal Injury</h5>
                        <p>If you are injured in an automobile accident or because of a fall on commercial premises, whether
                            you are at fault or not, you may be entitled to medical benefits and State disability benefits
                            while you are out of work. If the other driver, a defective product or the commercial property
                            owner’s negligence caused your injuries, you may seek compensation for your pain and suffering
                            and disability.</p>
                        <p>Kevin has been representing accident victims to obtain benefits, money settlements and verdicts for

                            of Judges and other attorneys against whom he has litigated. He has also been honored every year
                            for over 10 years by being selected by his peers as a Super Lawyer in New Jersey Monthly Magazine
                            for his personal injury and employment practice. Only around 4% of New Jersey Attorneys have
                            been so honored in any given year.</p>

                        <h5>Commercial Litigation for Small and Mid-Sized Businesses</h5>
                        <p>Kevin Kovacs has represented a wide range of businesses in complex legal disputes for over 30 years.
                            Now that he has his own firm he can focus on helping small to mid-sized Central Jersey companies
                            in their legal disputes at reasonable rates, without sacrificing quality or effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>Kevin has represented companies in:</p>

                            <li>Business dissolutions</li>
                            <li>Minority Shareholder disputes</li>
                            <li>Non-Compete and Theft of Confidential/Proprietary Information Claims</li>
                            <li>Commercial landlord tenant actions</li>
                            <li>Breach of contract</li>

                            <li>Employment law disputes including discrimination, harassment, retaliation and Wage and Hour claims</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>And unlike many of the big firm “litigators” Kevin has actually tried dozens of such cases and will
                            only settle if you are satisfied with the proposed result.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, if you want a consultation regarding a potential claim or are a lawsuit, call Kevin at (908)
                            526-7111 or e-mail him at Kovacslawoffice@gmail.com </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="workers-comp" class="col s12 grey lighten-4">
                        <h5>Worker's Compensation</h5>
                        <p>The New Jersey Worker’s Compensation Act, if you are injured on the job you have the right to medical
                            treatment and temporary disability benefits while you are out of work paid for by the employer’s
                            Worker’s Compensation carrier.</p>
                        <p>While you need to request authorization for treatment, insurance carriers all too often now have
                            only two purposes in mind: stop you from getting legitimate treatment and return you to work
                            no matter what so they can stop paying benefits. Also, some employers try to deny that you were
                            injured on the job to avoid making a claim. But you do not have to take their answer as the final
                            say. Kevin Kovacs has been helping injured workers for over 30 years obtain the benefits they
                            are entitled to receive, and going to Court if necessary to get an Order to Compel employers
                            and insurance carriers to abide by the Law and provide those benefits, at no cost to you.</p>
                        <p>Also, if you are injured on the job, you have the right to obtain a monetary award to compensate
                            you for the extent of the permanent disability you have suffered. Kevin will use his skill and
                            experience to get you the best result and if your case cannot settle for fair value he is prepared
                            to take it to Trial. The award he obtains for you will help offset the losses you suffered and
                            will also serve to extend the time when you can seek further treatment if your condition gets
                            worse. The cost to you is nothing up front and nothing if Kevin is not successful on your behalf.
                            The Court will award Kevin fees representing a small portion of the money he obtains for you.</p>
                        <p>So if you are injured on the job and need help navigating the complex and all too often frustrating
                            system, call Kevin at (908) 526-7111 or e-mail him at Kovacslawoffice@gmail.com</p>

                        <h5>Employment Law</h5>
                        <p>Kevin is somewhat unique in the world of employment law. Over the course of his 30-year career he
                            has represented both sides in such claims: employers and employees, and still does.</p>
                        <p>Kevin has represented Fortune 500 companies, and mid and small-sized businesses successfully fend
                            off claims of discriminations, harassment, retaliation and wrongful discharge. Also, he fights
                            for the wronged employee to obtain just compensation and punitive damages where warranted.</p>
                        <p>Kevin understands the law and the dynamics of an employment law case, which sometimes gets very personal.
                            Kevin knows how to identify the issues, investigate and learn the facts and present your case
                            with true insight on how to achieve a successful result.</p>
                        <p>So if you are a small or mid-sized business faced with a claim of discrimination, harassment, retaliation
                            or wrongful discharge or just want a consultation before making a personnel decision that may
                            lead to such a claim, call Kevin at (908) 526-7111 or e-mail him at Kovacslawoffice@gmail.com</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if you are an officer, manager or employee of a company being separated from employment,
                            or the victim of discrimination, retaliation or harassment or if you are subject to a non-compete
                            agreement and have questions, call Kevin at (908) 526-7111 or e-mail him at Kovacslawoffice@gmail.com</p>
