                                <p>Kevin brings a diverse and interesting background to his practice of law. He was born and
                                    raised in New Brunswick, New Jersey, played football at St. Peter’s High School, worked
                                    his way through college and went on to graduate second in his class at Rutgers Law School.
                                    He has served his community and his clients well and runs his own practice during the
                                    day and teaches college history courses in the evening. .</p>
                                <p>Kevin graduated from Rutgers Law School with High Honors. He served as Notes and Comments
                                    Editor for the University’s Law Journal and won awards for an article he published and
                                    his outstanding achievements in the classroom.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="second-row">
                            <p>Kevin’s education, however, did not stop with graduation from law school. After raising three
                                children with his wife, Beth, he returned to school and earned a Master’s Degree in History
                                from Montclair University. Kevin had tutored law students while in Law School, served as
                                a volunteer coach for high school students in mock trial competitions, guided new lawyers
                                in the Somerset County Inns of Court program and taught Business Law for several years. Kevin
                                has also been a frequent speaker on legal topics for the New Jersey State Bar Association,
                                the Somerset County Bar Association and Business and Insurance Groups.
                            </p>
                            <p>Now he has taken that education and experience and is teaching History as an Adjacent Professor
                                in the evening at Middlesex County College. Kevin truly believes that his background in History
                                and training in teaching serves his clients well. Having a foundation in History is a great
                                tool to better present forceful arguments in a Courtroom and being a teacher helps to communicate
                                the right message to the Judge and Jury.</p>
                            <p>Kevin has spent the last 30 years in handling a wide variety of legal matters, wrongful discharge,
                                business disputes, personal injury claims and Worker’s Compensation matters. In addition
                                to helping his clients achieve successful results, his arguments have made law through many
                                published Appellate Court Decisions.</p>
                            <p> But apart from his legal skills and efforts, Kevin has served his community and has been recognized
                                for it. Kevin has been President of the Somerset County Bar Association, a Trustee of Somerset/Sussex
                                Legal Services, a Board member of the Central Jersey Food Bank and a volunteer for the Central
                                Jersey United Way. He has been recognized for his service receiving the prestigious Legal
                                Service Equal Justice Medal for outstanding pro bono services to low income individuals,
                                The Best of Branchburg Award for Community Service and the Paul Harris Award from the Rotary
                                Club for exceptional service.</p>
